# Find-Optimise

This app can analyse Android bootlogs (either captured live or from a file) to
find all apps that are being optimised on boot. Occasionally, Android will
optimise an app on every boot, which greatly increases boot time and is generally
annoying.

Unfortunately, the only real options to prevent an app from causing this are to
either update, reinstall or uninstall the offending app.
